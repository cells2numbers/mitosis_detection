Benchmark data set published in [1].
This benchmark data set contains 552 images of mitotic 
cells, 401 images of non mitotic cells and 594 images 
of dead cells. The complete data set is based on the 
reference data CeTReS.B that was introduced in [2].

To generate the data, for each mitosis a patch of size 
41x41 was stored as a png file. The name of each mitosis 
consists of three parts,

FRAME_XCOORD_YCOORD.png

where FRAME is the number of the frame to which the 
image corresponds. XCOORD and YCOORD store the 
coordinates of the top left corner of the patch.
